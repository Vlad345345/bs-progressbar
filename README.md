```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bs-progressbar.css">
    <title>Progress Bar Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<div id="content">
    <h1>Loading Content...</h1>
</div>

<script src="path/to/bs-progressbar.js"></script>
<script>
    const progressBar = new ProgressBar();
    progressBar.start();

    // Simulate loading
    setTimeout(() => {
        progressBar.stop();
        document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = '<h1>Content Loaded!</h1>';
    }, 3000);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Advanced Example

function fetchData() {
    progressBar.start();
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            progressBar.stop();
            console.log(data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            progressBar.stop();
            console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
        });
}
